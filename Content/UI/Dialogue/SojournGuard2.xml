			<Text time="180">The kid’s asking for it! He’s a pain in the rear of the entire town, and frankly I’m a bit sick of him causing all this trouble. I give him all these warnings, but as soon as I take matters into my hands I’m the asshole. So I’ve decided: I don’t care about him anymore. He’s their problem now.</Text>

			<Text time="120">Can you blame me? Sojourn is on the edge of the world, on the brink of the unknown. Prime adventure terrain, right? Nope, nothing out here but trees and slimes! And to top it off, nobody new ever shows up! I haven’t had a proper fight in years!</Text>

			<Text time="150">What’re you doing askin’ me?! All I ever do is stand around here watching paint dry! If you’re looking for company, there’re a few others that live here. The Guard over by the well is fine, I guess. Or you could talk to the Merchant in the house over there. If you don’t wanna chat with someone, you’re outta luck as far as I’m concerned.</Text>
