# Overmorrow

## Folder Structure

- **Content**: Contains all elements that are directly interactable within the game, you can see or use it.
- **Assets**: Contains all the game assets like textures, sprites, and maps that are used.
- **Common**: Includes shared code that can be used by content and core. This includes utility functions and base classes.
- **Core**: Contains the core mod logic, including world generation, global overrides, and gameplay mechanics.

## Development Notes

- Follow the folder structure guidelines to maintain consistency.
- All textures should be stored in **Assets**.
- Utility functions and shared code (like base classes) should go in **Common**.
- Core functionality and mod initialization code goes in **Core**.
